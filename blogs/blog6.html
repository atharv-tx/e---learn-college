              A web developer may work with technology, but working with people
              is also an important feature for this professional profiles. Did
              you know that “teamwork” is in the TOP 5 of the most valued soft
              skills? And that in 2020 it will be even more relevant than it is
              today? The Future Work Skills 2020 study establishes that “quality
              management, teamwork skills and the ability to adapt to new
              technologies” will be the skills most valued in 2020 by companies.
            </p>

              Do you work well in a team? Do you like it? In the workplace, the
              so-called “hard skills” can be learned (for example, a new program
              to develop your work, or a specific methodology), while soft
              skills (personal attributes that help people to interact
              effectively with others) are more difficult to learn, but not
              impossible. Therefore, learning to work in a team is essential in
              multidisciplinary and transversal work environments where many
              departments or profiles come into play. An example of this
              environment would be the one any web developer works in. In
              addition, teamwork promotes happiness in your position and thus
              avoids a bad work environment and its disastrous consequences. Did
              you know that feeling happy at work as well as increasing personal
              satisfaction, self-esteem and productivity, favours creativity and
              interest in innovation? We spend a third of each day working
              (imagine what it means in a lifetime), don’t you think being happy
              at work and transferring that happiness to all the people around
              can only help?

              What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man
              set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.

              A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who,
              upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her
              violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time.
              I could not help but love and cherish her.
            </p>

              For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds
              and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly
              changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world
              are far more valuable than those which divide us.

              There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’
              Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the
              generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is
              always the thrill of just beginning.

              The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of

              Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one
              man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which
              mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of
              human development.

              As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in
              size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most
              beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object
              looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a
              finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change
              a man.
