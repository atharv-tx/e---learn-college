              let’s talk about the developers who are already in the industry
              and working on some frontend part of the project. How do you feel
              when you are asked to write the same line of code at multiple
              places? How do you feel when you’re asked to add the same button
              on multiple pages?
            </p>
            <p>
              We know that in software development doing repetitive tasks is
              frustrating and developers always look for some framework or
              method to save their precious time. Here React comes into the
              picture.
              <br />
              This popular amazing JavaScript library not just helps the
              developers to build an impressive application but also helps them
              in building the frontend page in less time. React is
              component-based and that’s the coolest feature of this library.
              You can break down your complex code into individual pieces i.e
              components. These components are helpful in organizing the code in
              a better way.

              1. Learn the Fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            </h2>
            <p>
              Learning this library is not easy if you don’t take the right step
              towards it. There are many concepts in React and it can be
              overwhelming to learn this library. It is important to know the
              right things in this library to become an in-demand React
              Developer. Today in this blog we are going to list down the key
              skills that are needed to become a proficient React Developer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your core concepts should be strong before you jump to this
              library. If you’re an experienced developer then you just need to
              revise the concepts.
              <br />
              If we talk about beginners then most of the time they make
              mistakes, and they directly jump to this library. Later they don’t
              understand the concept and keep struggling with understanding this
              library. Also, your interviewer will firstly check the basic
              concepts before jumping to React.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understand the basic building blocks of the website. How HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript work. React syntax and most of the concepts of
              this library are based on mainly these three building blocks. You
              won’t face any problems while building an application if these
              fundamentals are clear to you. Create something on your own using
              these three building blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              React inherits most of the features from JavaScript. Both are
              connected so it’s good to have a solid foundation in JavaScript
              concepts. Let’s discuss some basic concepts of JavaScript that are
              needed for React.
              <br />
              Variables, objects, arrays, functions, and classes. Common array
              methods such as .map(), .filter(), .reduce() ES6 features such as
              arrow function, let, const. Learn about ‘this’ keyword, call,
              apply, and bind method. Concepts of Asynchronous JavaScript such
              as promises, callback, Async/Await. Learn how DOM (document object
              model) works. How to create, select, and update the HTML elements
              and their attributes.
            </p>
            <p>
              There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’
              Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the
              generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is
              always the thrill of just beginning.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              2. Fundamentals of NodeJS, Import, and Export Keyword
            </h2>
            <p>
              Being a React developer you will run a lot of NPM
              scripts/commands, so once the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, and
              JavaScript) are clear to you, understand the fundamentals of
              NodeJS.
              <br />
              NPM (Node Package Manager): You should have knowledge about NPM
              (Node package manage). NPM is used to install the Node modules and
              packages. Learn how to use the basic commands/scripts to install
              the packages and modules.
              <br />
              Import Keyword: You will have to use the import keyword in your
              React project to use the installed Node modules.
              <br />
              Export Keyword: Use this keyword when you are creating a
              module/component and you have to return only a part, not all the
              methods and variables.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              3.Learn to Work With the APIs in React Apps
            </h2>
            <p>
              We know that React is a front-end library to build the user
              interfaces. A user interacts with the frontend part of the
              application, access the data from there, or navigate from one page
              to another page.
              <br />

              React interacts with the backend code of the application. We get
              the data from the backend part of the application, we perform
              actions such as authentication, display the item to the user,
              searching, registration of the user, etc.
              <br />

              Mainly there are two ways to work with the data from the backend.
              The most common and standard way is using the REST APIs. The other
              and the newer one is GraphQL API. In your work, you will encounter
              problems where you will have to work with both of the APIs. Learn
              how to work with both kinds of APIs using React.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">4.Redux</h2>
            <p>
              In your React application, you will have to manage the states.
              Once your application will start growing it will become a complex
              application and you will have to manage the states across
              components. Redux which a powerful JavaScript library solves this
              problem and helps in maintaining the state of the application. In
              Redux, you store all your states in a single source.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Final Thought</h2>
            We discussed the main concept that you should learn in React. Once
            you will start working on some React project, you will encounter
            many problems, and depending on the issues you will have to search
            for an efficient solution in React. You will be introduced to
            different libraries or packages in React depending on the problems.
            Slowly you will go in-depth with this application and you will
            become a master in React. Hope this was helpful.
